# Netflix
In this project, I leveraged Tableau to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's data, focusing on various aspects such as content performance, viewing trends, and subscriber demographics. My goal was to uncover insights that highlight Netflix’s strategic positioning and content effectiveness.

**Key Components:**

1. **Data Visualization:**
 - Created interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize:
 - Patterns in the dates when movies and TV shows were added to Netflix
 - Variations in descriptions across different genres
 - Distribution of durations for movies and TV shows
 - Prevalence of genres and their distribution on Netflix
 - Quantity and type of movies versus TV shows
 - Distribution of ratings and their variation across genres
 - Trends in the release years of Netflix content
 - Top 10 most popular genres and their distribution
 - Total number of movies and TV shows released each year

2. **Insights and Analysis:**
 - Leveraged dynamic charts, heat maps, and trend lines to analyze:
 - How the release dates of content impact viewer engagement
 - Geographic diversity in content production and popularity
 - The effect of original content on viewer retention and subscription trends
 - Viewer preferences based on genre and content duration
 - Rating distributions and their implications for content quality

3. **Interactive Dashboard:**
 - Developed interactive dashboard that allow users to:
 - Explore data in real-time
 - Filter by different parameters
 - Gain deeper insights into Netflix’s content strategy and performance
